## Overview

FlagHub is engineered for developers and enterprises who need a robust and customizable flag display solution without the overhead of unnecessary dependencies. Our modular approach ensures that you install and integrate only what your project requires, providing optimal performance and flexibility.

Key goals include:

- **Scalability:** Designed to support enterprise-scale applications.
- **Customization:** Lightweight core logic that can be extended with premium features.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Future-proof integrations for web, mobile, desktop, server, and more.

## Architecture & Modular Design

FlagHub is built around a central core that handles the flag-fetching logic. This core is wrapped by multiple platform-specific packages to suit various needs:

- **flag-url-core:** The backbone that provides the flag-fetching logic.
- **flag-url-react:** A React component for seamless integration in React apps.
- **flag-url-js:** A vanilla JavaScript module for lightweight, dependency-free usage.
- **flag-url-html:** A CDN-ready script for direct inclusion in web pages.
- **CLI & Serverless Packages:** For Node.js-based applications, serverless functions, and command-line utilities.

Each package is designed to be independent, ensuring minimal footprint and maximum reusability across projects.

---

## Features

- **Lightweight & Modular:** Use only the packages you need.
- **Customizable UI Components:** Adapt styles and themes as required.
- **Cross-Platform:** Planned integrations for modern frameworks and native platforms.
- **Serverless-Ready:** Deploy backend services with tools like Cloudflare Workers.
- **Scalable Monetization Models:** Explore freemium, API subscription, and donation-based revenue models.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Future support for API SDKs, GraphQL integration, CMS plugins, and more.

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Country Flag</h1>
      <CountryFlag countryName="Germany" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### flag-url-js

For a lightweight JavaScript usage:
