Possible Improvements:
ðŸ”¹ Cloudinary Signature Generation Issue:
The signature is being generated using crypto.subtle.digest(), but Cloudinary typically expects an HMAC-SHA1/256-based signature rather than a direct SHA-256 hash. Consider using crypto.subtle.importKey() and crypto.subtle.sign() with HMAC-SHA256.

ðŸ”¹ Better Logging for Debugging:
While errors are logged with console.error(), a more structured logging approach (e.g., sending logs to an external monitoring service like Datadog or Cloudflare Workers Logpush) would be beneficial for debugging in production.

ðŸ”¹ Potential KV Storage Optimization:
KV storage might have a limit on write operations, especially if there are high concurrent requests. If needed, consider batching writes.


Minor Suggestions (Very Minor):

While the background refresh is good, you could add some logging or monitoring around it to track its success or failures.
Consider adding some form of logging to the successful calls, not just the errors. This can be very useful for debugging in production.
